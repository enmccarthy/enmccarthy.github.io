title: Neural Net in Haskell!
---

I built a neural net from scratch in Haskell! Right now it is current at the bare minimum working. See it here: https://github.com/enmccarthy/hcnn

I have a long list of TODOs for this project, including extending functionality, implementing tests, better documentation and parallelizing it. I hope to update this post eventually to document the things I learned from this project.
