title: Neural Net in C++!
---
-- holder for c++ neural net project that is currently in the works -- 

I am currently creating a neural net in C++, and hope to optimize it using cudNN. Creating a windows environment for C++ and CUDA proves to be quite a challenge. I was not able to use my default linux subsystem since you cannot directly access hardware, but I have been using Visual Studio. I am not sure how I feel about this yet, it seems very clunky but the 2017 version has come a long way since the 2015 release.
