I am a graduate student at the University of Oregon, studying Computer Science with an emphasis on the application of Machine Learning. 
I have a passion for Algorithms and patterns which led me to my interest in the application of Machine Learing. 
In my free time I enjoy fencing, and swimming as well as working on my personal projects. 
My personal project currently consist of building machine learning models from scratch in different languages, predicting the stock market using machine learning and building a drone with 3D printed parts.
