I am a graduate student at the University of Oregon, studying Computer Science. I am interested in applying Machine Learning and High Performance Computing to interesting problems to extract information. My favorite application is applying my work to Neuroscience to increase the understanding of how the brain works. 

I have an interest in algorithms and finding patterns which led me to my interest in Machine Learing. 
In my free time I enjoy fencing, biking, swimming and working on my personal projects.

My personal projects currently consist of building models from scratch in different languages, predicting the stock market using machine learning and building a drone with 3D printed parts.
