I am a graduate student at the University of Oregon, studying Computer Science with an emphasis on the application of Machine Learning. I am interested in applying Machine Learning and High Performance Computing to Neuroscience to create more accurate models. More generally I have an interest in Computer Science education and tools that allow people to use Machine Learning more efficiently.


I have an interest in algorithms and finding patterns which led me to my interest in the application of Machine Learing.
In my free time I enjoy fencing, biking, swimming and working on my personal projects.

My personal project currently consist of building machine learning models from scratch in different languages, predicting the stock market using machine learning and building a drone with 3D printed parts.
